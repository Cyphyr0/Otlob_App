# Otlob Mobile App Design Prompt for Figma AI

**Create a complete, modern 2025 interactive mobile experience** for a food delivery app focused on authentic Egyptian cuisine discovery.

**This will be built using React Native or Flutter** - design with full interactivity and animations in mind.

**Make it:** Modern • Beautiful • Interactive • Trustworthy • Uniquely Egyptian

## The Core Concept

Otlob (أطلب) is a revolutionary food delivery app specifically for the Egyptian market. Unlike international apps like Uber Eats or DoorDash that flood users with generic international chains, Otlob celebrates **authentic Egyptian cuisine and local heroes from ALL food creators**.

**Critical Note:** The app focuses on **ALL restaurants and kitchens** - from established family businesses to home cooks who prepare food from their kitchens, cloud kitchens, and anyone passionate about Egyptian cuisine. It's an inclusive platform that democratizes food discovery for anyone who creates delicious food, not just corporate establishments.

The app solves the "choice paralysis" problem where Egyptians are overwhelmed by too many options and the "trust erosion" of fake reviews manipulated by paid advertising.

**Tagline/Slogan:** "Don't wait.. just Otlob"

**Brand Color:** #FF5A5F (Use as main or accent color - the primary brand color for the app)

**Brand Font:** Tutano CC V2 (Use this font for branding elements, headings, and the logo)

**Core Value Proposition:** "Discover Egypt's authentic, hidden food gems - not generic chains. Real reviews from real people. Community votes for local heroes."

**Unique Differentiation:**
- **Tawseya System**: Monthly community voting where users get 1 precious "Tawseya" (recommendation) vote per restaurant per month
- **Dual Rating System**: Separate ratings for food quality vs. delivery experience
- **Authentic Discovery**: Focus on local, family-owned restaurants, home cooks, and cloud kitchens
- **Inclusive Platform**: Anyone cooking Egyptian food can join - from home kitchens to professional setups
- **Authentic Experience**: Egyptian cultural elements in English interface, local payment methods

## Problems We're Solving

**Choice Paralysis**: Egyptians visit the app overwhelmed by hundreds of similar restaurants with indistinguishable branding
**Trust Issues**: Fake reviews and paid promotions erode confidence in ordering decisions
**Cultural Disconnect**: International apps don't understand Egyptian tastes and preferences
**Local Hero Support**: Genuine quality restaurants get lost in generic algorithms
****Economic Impact**: Support local businesses instead of international corporations

## User Personas & Target Audience
