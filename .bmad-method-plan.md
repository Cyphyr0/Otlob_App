## BMAD-METHOD Setup Progress
- [x] Install BMAD-METHOD npm package
- [x] Create BMAD core configuration (.bmad-core/core-config.yaml)
- [x] Set up technical preferences for Flutter/Clean Architecture
- [x] Analyze existing Otlob Flutter app features and architecture
- [x] Create BMAD-formatted PRD document (docs/prd.md)
- [x] Create BMAD-formatted Architecture document (docs/architecture.md)

## SM‚ÜíDev‚ÜíQA Workflow Demo ‚úÖ COMPLETED
Created a comprehensive BMAD-METHOD story document for implementing the Tawseya voting system - a core differentiator feature.

### Completed Story: Implement Tawseya Voting System
**Story Status:** üìù Draft (Ready for SM refinement)
**Location:** `docs/stories/epic-6/story-6.1-implement-tawseya-voting-system.md`

**Story Contains:**
- Complete user story with business context
- Detailed acceptance criteria (functional + non-functional)
- Full technical design (domain, data, presentation layers)
- Implementation phases and risk assessment
- Testing strategy and success metrics
- File structure and dependencies

> **This demonstrates** how BMAD-METHOD transforms feature requests into detailed, implementable specifications that guide agents through development cycles.

## üìã NEXT TASK: Documentation Critique & Enhancement

### üéØ **TASK: Critically Evaluate & Improve All Documentation**

**Scope:**
- Analyze all master documents for quality, completeness, and alignment with Flutter/BMAD best practices
- Research latest Flutter and mobile development trends using MCP/web resources
- Enhance documentation with practical, actionable content
- Align with Otlob's specific use case (Egyptian food delivery, Tawseya system)

**Analysis Framework:**
1. **Relevance:** Does content match Otlob's specific business context?
2. **Completeness:** Are all necessary sections covered with sufficient depth?
3. **Practicality:** Are examples implementable and realistic?
4. **Up-to-date:** Do standards reflect current Flutter/BMAD best practices?
5. **BMAD Alignment:** How well integrated with BMAD methodology?

**Research Sources to Use:**
- Flutter documentation and best practices
- BMAD-METHOD latest updates
- Mobile app development standards
- Egyptian market considerations
- Firebase best practices for Flutter

## üìã Next Steps for Full BMAD-METHOD Adoption

1. **Agent Configuration:** Set up Cursor AI agents with BMAD roles
2. **Development Cycles:** Begin SM‚ÜíDev‚ÜíQA cycles on priority features
3. **Quality Gate Setup:** Implement automated testing gates
4. **Team Training:** Train development team on BMAD workflows
5. **Measure Impact:** Track improvements in code quality and development speed

## üìã **NEW TASK: Documentation Consolidation**

## üéØ **Consolidation Strategy**

### **Duplicate Files Identified:**
- **PRD files:** `PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md` (BEST) vs `prd.md` (duplicate)
- **Architecture files:** `FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md` (BEST) vs `architecture.md` (duplicate)
- **Rule files:** Multiple overlapping rule files (.ai_rules.md, .flutter-rules.md, etc.)
- **Mission files:** Multiple brief/mission docs with overlapping content

### **Consolidation Plan:**
- **Keep BEST content** from each category, remove duplicates
- **Merge complementary content** into master documents
- **Create unified structure** with clear navigation
- **Preserve BMAD-METHOD** integration while cleaning duplicates

## Implementation Tasks - COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION ENHANCEMENT COMPLETED ‚úÖ
