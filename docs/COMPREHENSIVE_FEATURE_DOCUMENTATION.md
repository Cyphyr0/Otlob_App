## 1. Core Technical Architecture

### 1.1 Architecture Pattern: Clean Architecture

The application follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

```

├── core/                    # Shared utilities and services
│   ├── config/             # App configuration (Firebase, payments)
│   ├── services/           # Core services (location, notifications)
│   ├── theme/              # Design system and theming
│   ├── widgets/            # Reusable UI components
│   └── utils/              # Helper functions and utilities
│
└── features/               # Feature-based modular architecture
    ├── auth/               # Authentication system
    ├── home/               # Restaurant discovery
    ├── tawseya/            # Community voting system
    ├── cart/               # Shopping cart
    ├── favorites/          # User favorites
    ├── location/           # Location services
    ├── payment/            # Payment processing
    └── profile/            # User profile management
```

### 1.2 State Management: Riverpod Architecture

**Provider Strategy by Use Case:**
- **AsyncNotifierProvider**: API data fetching and complex state management
- **StateNotifierProvider**: Complex business logic state transitions
- **StateProvider**: Simple local state management
- **StreamProvider**: Real-time data streams
- **Provider**: Computed values and simple derivations

**Example Implementation:**
```dart
@riverpod
class RestaurantList extends _$RestaurantList {
  @override
  Future<List<Restaurant>> build(String location) async {
    final repository = ref.read(restaurantRepositoryProvider);
    return repository.getRestaurants(location);
  }

  Future<void> refresh() async {
    state = const AsyncValue.loading();
    state = await AsyncValue.guard(() async {
      final repository = ref.read(restaurantRepositoryProvider);
      return repository.getRestaurants('current_location');
    });
  }
}
```

### 1.3 Data Layer Architecture

#### Repository Pattern Implementation
```dart
// Domain Layer - Abstract Interface
abstract class RestaurantRepository {
  Future<Either<Failure, List<Restaurant>>> getRestaurants(String location);
  Future<Either<Failure, Restaurant>> getRestaurantById(String id);
}

// Data Layer - Concrete Implementation
class RestaurantRepositoryImpl implements RestaurantRepository {
  final RestaurantRemoteDataSource remoteDataSource;
  final RestaurantLocalDataSource localDataSource;

  @override
  Future<Either<Failure, List<Restaurant>>> getRestaurants(String location) async {
    try {
      final models = await remoteDataSource.fetchRestaurants(location);
      final entities = models.map((m) => m.toEntity()).toList();
      return Right(entities);
    } on ServerException catch (e) {
      return Left(ServerFailure(e.message));
    }
  }
}
```

#### Local Storage Strategy
- **Drift SQLite**: Structured data persistence (cart, favorites, user data)
- **SharedPreferences**: Simple key-value pairs (settings, tokens)
- **SecureStorage**: Encrypted sensitive data (auth tokens, payment info)

### 1.4 Backend Integration: Firebase Ecosystem

**Firebase Services Integration:**
- **Authentication**: Multi-provider auth (Email, Phone, Google, Facebook)
- **Firestore**: Real-time database for restaurants, orders, votes
- **Storage**: Image storage for restaurant photos and user uploads
- **Messaging**: Push notifications for order updates
- **Analytics**: User behavior tracking and crash reporting
