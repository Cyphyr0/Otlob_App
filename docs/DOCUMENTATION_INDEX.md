## 📋 **Development Workflows**

### Before Starting Development
```
1. Read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md → Understand product vision
2. Read DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md → Learn rules and setup
3. Check PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md → See what to build
4. Review FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md → Follow patterns
5. Check CURRENT_STATUS.md → See what's already done
```

### Feature Implementation Flow
```
1. Read requirements in PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md
2. Create story in docs/stories/ (use BMAD-METHOD format)
3. Follow architecture patterns from FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md
4. Implement using guidelines from DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md
5. Test per FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md Section 10
6. Update status in PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md
```

### Before Code Commits
```
□ flutter analyze → No errors
□ flutter test → Tests pass (if any)
□ check DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md security rules
□ meaningful commit message
□ update documentation if needed
```
