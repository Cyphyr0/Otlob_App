## üî¥ **CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED**

### 1. **UPDATED: Riverpod vs BLoC Analysis - Riverpod Is Superior for Modern Flutter 2025**
**New Findings from Deep Dive Research:**
- **Riverpod dominates** the Flutter state management landscape in 2025
- **Riverpod is MORE modern and flexible** than BLoC for most use cases
- **BLoC remains premiere for complex BUSINESS LOGIC**, but Riverpod excels at state management
- **Since you already have Riverpod infrastructure**, keep it! Riverpod is the 2025 trend leader
-
**Recommendation Change:**
- **‚úÖ Keep Riverpod as primary choice** - It's dominating and your current architecture is optimal
- **‚úÖ Use BLoC only where Riverpod feels too simple** - Not as a replacement, but as a complement
- **‚úÖ Riverpod + BLoC hybrid approach justified** - Riverpod for most state, BLoC for ultra-complex business logic

### 2. **Performance Guidelines Missing**
**Issue:** No mention of critical Flutter performance patterns
- **Gap:** Missing constraint understanding (Flutter's biggest issue)
- **Gap:** No build function purity guidelines
- **Impact:** Poor app performance, bad user experience
- **Fix:** Add comprehensive performance section

### 3. **BMAD Integration Surface-Level**
**Issue:** BMAD mentioned but not deeply integrated
- **Gap:** No 6-step workflow integration
- **Gap:** Missing agent optimization guidelines
- **Gap:** No agent-as-code examples
- **Fix:** BMAD-first approach to all processes

### 4. **Egyptian Context Missing**
**Issue:** Generic app guidelines, not Egyptian market-specific
- **Gap:** No Arabic/RTL considerations
- **Gap:** Generic payment references
- **Gap:** Missing Egyptian consumer behavior
- **Impact:** Poor localization, irrelevant features
- **Fix:** Egypt-first development guidelines

### 5. **Agent Optimization Missing**
**Issue:** No guidelines for lean agent contexts
- **Gap:** Dev agents getting full context dumps
- **Gap:** No context scoping strategies
- **Gap:** Missing BMAD agent optimization patterns
- **Fix:** Agent-first development guidelines
