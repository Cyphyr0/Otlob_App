### 2. Created `ADVANCED_ARCHITECTURE_PATTERNS.md` (New Document - ~800 lines)

**Purpose:** Extracted best practices and patterns from old architecture documents

**Key Contents:**

**Clean Architecture Implementation:**
- Three-layer architecture (Presentation ‚Üí Domain ‚Üí Data)
- Complete code examples for:
  - Domain entities (pure business objects)
  - Repository interfaces (contracts)
  - Use cases (single-purpose actions)
  - Data models (serializable with Freezed)
  - Data sources (API/database access)
  - Repository implementations (with offline support)

**Riverpod State Management Patterns (7 Patterns):**
1. **Provider** - Immutable, globally-shared data
2. **StateProvider** - Simple mutable values
3. **StateNotifier** - Complex state logic
4. **FutureProvider** - One-time async operations
5. **StreamProvider** - Real-time data streams
6. **Dependent Providers** - Provider that watches another
7. **Family Providers** - Parameterized providers

**Error Handling Patterns:**
- Complete failure type hierarchy
- Exception types
- Error handling in repositories with Either<Failure, T>

**API Client Architecture:**
- Dio configuration with interceptors
- **AuthInterceptor** - Adds bearer token
- **RetryInterceptor** - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **ErrorInterceptor** - Global error handling, token refresh

**Testing Strategies:**
- Unit testing repositories (with mocks)
- Widget testing components
- Integration testing full flows
- Complete test examples

**Component Development Standards:**
- Component template with documentation
- Naming conventions table
- Best practices

**Performance Optimization:**
- Image loading with cached_network_image
- List performance (ListView.builder, AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin)
- Const constructors

  - Phase 1: Product understanding
  - Phase 2: Technical implementation (added `ADVANCED_ARCHITECTURE_PATTERNS.md`)
  - Phase 3: Current status
  - Phase 4: Validation

---

### 4. Updated `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`

**Changes:**
- **Added "For Designers" section** at top of quick start
- **Added `UI_UX_REDESIGN_BRIEF.md`** as highest priority document
- **Added `ADVANCED_ARCHITECTURE_PATTERNS.md`** in technical implementation section
- **Reorganized reading order** to prioritize UI/UX redesign
- **Clear distinction** between:
