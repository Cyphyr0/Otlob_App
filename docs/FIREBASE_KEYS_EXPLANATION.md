# 🚨 Firebase API Keys Security Check

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Status:** 🔴 3 API Keys Leaked on GitHub

## 🔴 Leaked Keys (From GitHub Alert)

### 1. Android Key
- **Key:** `AIzaSyBG-Rd6UvLBUTDTuYmc1s4A3NyAcYvrMJU`
- **App:** Android (com.example.flutterApplication1)
- **Status:** ⚠️ LEAKED in commit 43779e3

### 2. iOS Key  
- **Key:** `AIzaSyC94tGd4dz4KDfthv2CIVQ4pbHEB9aww-w`
- **App:** iOS
- **Status:** ⚠️ LEAKED in commit 43779e3

### 3. Web Key
- **Key:** `AIzaSyABY8EhUGSVqeyYyxp_KBuAVHMsmaezvPo`  
- **App:** Web
- **Status:** ⚠️ LEAKED in commit 43779e3

## ✅ Current Keys in Google Cloud Console

From your screenshot, you have these keys:

1. **otlob_app (ios), for com.example.flutterApplication1** - ✅ Restricted to 24 APIs
2. **otlob_app (web)** - ✅ Restricted to 24 APIs  
3. **iOS key** - ✅ Restricted to Android apps, 24 APIs
4. **Android key** - ✅ Restricted to Android apps, 24 APIs
5. **Browser key** - ✅ Restricted to Android apps, 24 APIs

## 🎯 ACTION REQUIRED - Verify Each Key

### Click "Show key" for each and check:

#### Android Key:
- [ ] Application restrictions: **Android apps**
  - Package name: `com.example.flutter_application_1`
  - SHA-1: `EB:BB:D2:D9:E9:56:93:AE:61:68:12:EC:90:E0:A2:93:78:B5:41:BE`
- [ ] API restrictions: **Restrict key** to:
  - Firebase Installations API
  - Cloud Firestore API
  - Firebase Cloud Messaging API
  - Identity Toolkit API
  - Token Service API

#### iOS Key:
- [ ] Application restrictions: **iOS apps**
  - Bundle ID: `com.example.flutterApplication1`
- [ ] API restrictions: **Restrict key** to same APIs as Android

#### Web Key:
- [ ] Application restrictions: **HTTP referrers**
  - Add your domain when you have one
  - For now: `localhost:*/*` and your Firebase hosting domain
- [ ] API restrictions: **Restrict key** to same APIs

## 🔧 Quick Fix Steps

### Option 1: If keys are already restricted properly ✅
The keys are already secured! GitHub is just alerting you they were in Git history. Since:
- `firebase_options.dart` is now in `.gitignore`
- Keys are restricted to your app only
- No one can use them without your app package + SHA-1

**Action:** Dismiss the GitHub alerts as "used in tests" or "false positive"

### Option 2: If you want to be extra safe (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Delete the 3 OLD leaked keys:**
   - In Google Cloud Console → Credentials
   - Find keys matching the leaked values
   - Click ⋮ → Delete

2. **Keep the NEW restricted keys** from your screenshot

3. **Update firebase_options.dart** with the NEW key values

4. **Verify app still works**

## 🔐 Best Practice Going Forward

Since Firebase API keys are **meant to be public** (they're in your app), the real security comes from:

1. ✅ **Application restrictions** (SHA-1 for Android)
2. ✅ **API restrictions** (only Firebase APIs)
3. ✅ **Firestore Security Rules** (control data access)
4. ✅ **App Check** (prevent API abuse)

Firebase keys are NOT like secret tokens - they're designed to be embedded in apps!

## 📝 Explanation: Why Firebase Keys Can Be "Public"

Firebase API keys are **identifiers, not secrets**. They:
- ❌ Don't grant access by themselves
- ✅ Are restricted by package name + SHA-1
- ✅ Are protected by Firestore/Storage rules
- ✅ Are meant to be in your app code

**The real security is:**
1. App restrictions (your SHA-1)
2. Backend rules (Firestore security rules)
3. App Check (optional but recommended)

## 🎯 Recommendation

Since `firebase_options.dart` is now in `.gitignore`:
1. ✅ Future commits won't leak keys
2. ✅ Keys are restricted in Google Cloud  
3. ✅ Firestore rules will control data access
4. ⚠️ Old keys in Git history are visible but restricted

**You can either:**
- **A)** Keep current restricted keys (they're safe)
- **B)** Delete old keys and use only the new ones from screenshot

## 🚀 Immediate Action

Run this to verify your current keys:

```powershell
# Check what's in your current firebase_options.dart
Get-Content lib\firebase_options.dart | Select-String "apiKey"
```

Then compare with the keys in Google Cloud Console screenshot.

---

**Bottom Line:** Firebase keys being "leaked" isn't as critical as traditional API keys, because they're restricted. Focus on:
1. ✅ App restrictions (SHA-1) 
2. ✅ Firestore security rules
3. ✅ App Check for production
